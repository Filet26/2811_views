Each team will be provided with several UI designs from another team.

Using Jakob Nielsen's 10 Heuristics, for each heuristic describe if the application follows the heuristic. 

- If the application follows the heuristic provide examples, or explain why you think it succeeds in meeting the requirements of that heuristic
- If the application does not follow the heuristic make a suggestion for how the application UI could be improved.

You can also include comments on how you think an interface can be improved if it mostly meets a heuristic evaluations requirements.

Your report will be forwarded to the team who created the UI your team  is evaluating.  So be honest, and professional

See the videos, link in the resources section below for a description of each heuristic if you need more information on any of the heuristic evaluations.
